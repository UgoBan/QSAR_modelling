# QSAR Modeling for Chemical Degradability

### Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) project focused on modeling the degradability of chemicals. QSAR is a computational modeling technique that predicts the properties and behavior of chemicals based on their structural properties. The degradability of chemicals is an important factor to assess their environmental impact and potential risks.
