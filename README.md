# QSAR Modeling for Chemical Degradability

### Introduction
This repository contains the code and resources for a Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) project focused on modeling the degradability of chemicals. QSAR is a computational modeling technique that predicts the properties and behavior of chemicals based on their structural properties. The degradability of chemicals is an important factor to assess their environmental impact and potential risks.

### Data Source
The dataset used for this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data can be accessed and downloaded from the following link: [QSAR Biodegradation Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/QSAR+biodegradation). Please refer to the original source for detailed information on the dataset and its attributes.

### Project Execution
The project was executed in a new environment to ensure reproducibility. Please refer to the requirements.txt file for a complete list of package dependencies and versions.

### Conclusion
The QSAR Modeling for Chemical Degradability project aims to predict the degradability of chemicals based on their structural properties. The repository provides the necessary code, resources, and instructions to reproduce the analysis and modeling steps. By leveraging QSAR modeling, we can contribute to sustainable practices, assess environmental impact, and support regulatory compliance.

Feel free to explore the repository, modify the code, and adapt it to your specific needs. For any questions or feedback, please contact: banabasejiofor@gmail.com.
